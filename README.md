- Hi, I’m @StopMotionBros
- I’m interested in game development and systems programing.
- How to reach me: you can't
- Fun fact: The closest star to the solar system, Alpha Centauri, is four light-years away, which means, interstellar travel will probably not be possible for a long time :).
- What I use: Vim (btw), C/C++, Rust, Unity
